Instead of folders use tags



To effectively retrieve and improve your notes and information in Obsidian, follow these strategies:

### **1. Efficient Retrieval**

1. **Use Advanced Search**
   - **Basic Search**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (or `Cmd+Shift+F` on Mac) to search for keywords across all notes.
   - **Search Operators**: Utilize operators like `tag:` for tags, `path:` for specific folders, or `file:` for specific files to refine your search.

2. **Leverage Tags and Links**
   - **Tags**: Consistently tag your notes. Tags help in quickly finding related notes.
   - **Internal Links**: Create links between related notes. Clicking on a link will take you directly to the connected note.

3. **Use the Graph View**
   - **Visual Exploration**: Use the Graph View to visualize the connections between your notes. This helps in finding related notes and understanding context.

4. **Utilize the Daily Notes**
   - **Track Entries**: Use daily notes to log activities, thoughts, and tasks. This can help you locate notes based on when they were created or updated.

5. **Maintain an Index or Dashboard**
   - **Index Note**: Create a master index with links to key topics and notes. This serves as a quick reference guide.
   - **Dashboard**: Set up a dashboard with widgets or links to frequently accessed notes and categories.
