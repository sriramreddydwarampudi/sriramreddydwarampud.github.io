While it's understandable that some people may feel that news is overwhelming, negative, or biased, saying that all news is useless overlooks its important functions in society. Here are a few reasons why news can be valuable, as well as some reasons why people may find it less useful:

### Value of News:
1. **Keeps People Informed**: News provides critical information about what’s happening locally, nationally, and globally, allowing people to stay updated on issues that may affect their lives.
   
2. **Promotes Awareness**: By highlighting social, political, and economic issues, news increases public awareness and encourages informed discussions and debates.

3. **Accountability**: News outlets can play a key role in holding governments, businesses, and other institutions accountable by investigating wrongdoing and informing the public.

4. **Emergency Information**: During crises, disasters, or urgent situations, the news provides timely updates and instructions that can help people stay safe.

5. **Cultural and Social Connection**: News stories about arts, culture, or local events help people feel connected to their communities and the world around them.

6. **Empowerment Through Knowledge**: Knowing what's going on enables people to make informed decisions about voting, investing, or participating in social and community issues.

### Why Some People Think News Is Useless:
1. **Sensationalism and Negativity**: Some news outlets focus heavily on sensational or negative stories, which can make the news seem like it’s only about bad events, leading to feelings of helplessness or pessimism.

2. **Bias and Misinformation**: Media bias and fake news can distort information, making it hard to trust certain sources. People may feel like they aren’t getting the full truth, which undermines the news' value.

3. **Information Overload**: The constant flood of news from various sources can be overwhelming, leading to a sense that much of the information is irrelevant or trivial.

4. **Repetitiveness**: News cycles often repeat the same stories or cover trivial matters extensively, making it feel like there’s no new or useful information being shared.

5. **Lack of Personal Relevance**: Some news stories may not feel directly relevant to a person's daily life, leading them to see it as unnecessary.

### Conclusion:
News is not inherently useless, but its quality and relevance can vary. Choosing trusted, balanced news sources and limiting exposure to negative or repetitive content can help make news consumption more meaningful.
