Social norms can vary across cultures, regions, and communities. What is considered acceptable in one place might not be in another.

It is not strictly necessary to follow social norms, but choosing not to can have various consequences depending on the context, culture, and specific norm. Here's what can happen if social norms are not followed:

### 1. **Social Disapproval**
   - **Consequences**: People may judge or criticize you for behaving outside accepted norms. This can lead to disapproval, negative perceptions, or being considered rude or disrespectful.
   
### 2. **Exclusion or Isolation**
   - **Consequences**: Breaking important social norms can lead to exclusion from social groups or events. Others might avoid interacting with you, leading to feelings of isolation.

### 3. **Loss of Trust and Respect**
   - **Consequences**: Violating norms, especially those related to respect or trust (e.g., not keeping promises or not respecting personal space), can damage relationships and make others hesitant to interact with you in the future.

### 4. **Legal or Institutional Consequences**
   - **Consequences**: Some norms are codified into laws or institutional rules. For example, not following traffic laws (which are also social norms) can result in fines or legal action.
   
### 5. **Cultural Misunderstandings**
   - **Consequences**: In cross-cultural settings, not following local norms might lead to misunderstandings or unintentional offense. This can strain relationships or cause discomfort for both parties.

### 6. **Reduced Social Influence**
   - **Consequences**: Social norms help build trust and rapport. People who donâ€™t follow norms may have a harder time gaining influence, building connections, or advancing in certain social or professional settings.

### 7. **Personal Freedom and Authenticity**
   - **Benefit**: On the positive side, rejecting certain norms can allow you to express yourself authentically, challenge outdated practices, or promote change in rigid or unjust systems.

### 8. **Innovation and Progress**
   - **Benefit**: Many societal advancements come from challenging existing norms, whether in science, art, or social movements. Breaking away from norms can foster creativity and new ways of thinking.

In summary, while following social norms can facilitate smoother interactions and social cohesion, breaking them can lead to consequences like social rejection, conflict, or legal issues. However, rejecting harmful or outdated norms can also pave the way for personal freedom and social change.
